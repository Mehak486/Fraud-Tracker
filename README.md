## ✨ Features

· Detects fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions  
· Uses machine learning classification algorithms  
· Web-based interface built with Flask  
· CSV file upload for transaction datasets  
· Data preprocessing and model evaluation  
· Graphical visualization of fraud analysis  
· User-friendly and interactive UI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly)  
- File Handling & Dataset Management

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a transaction dataset (CSV file)  
2. Data is preprocessed and cleaned  
3. Machine learning model analyzes the transactions  
4. System classifies transactions as **Fraud** or **Not Fraud**  
5. Results are displayed with graphs and insights
